Please evaluate the urban park quality in this image only.

Urban parks are designated green spaces within cities for public recreation, containing vegetation (trees, shrubs, grass), facilities (benches, shelters, playground equipment), and pathways.

Evaluate the image on a 1-5 scale for the following 6 criteria with specific reasoning based on observable elements.

Evaluation Criteria:

1. Facility Maintenance (1-5)
Physical condition and safety of park facilities and infrastructure.
- Factors: Rust, paint condition, structural damage, litter, cleanliness
- Scale: 5=excellent/no damage, 3=moderate wear, 1=severe deterioration/unsafe

2. Amenity Provision (1-5)
Availability and adequacy of rest facilities for users.
- Factors: Benches, shelters, tables, quantity and distribution
- Scale: 5=abundant/well-distributed, 3=basic facilities, 1=minimal/none

3. Vegetation Diversity (1-5)
Variety of plant species and vegetation layers.
- Factors: Trees, shrubs, grass, flowers, multi-layered structure
- Scale: 5=high diversity/multiple layers, 3=moderate/2-3 types, 1=monotonous/single type

4. Openness (1-5)
Degree of spatial openness and visual accessibility.
- Factors: Visual range, sky visibility, spatial transparency
- Scale: 5=completely open/wide visibility, 3=partially open/balanced, 1=enclosed/limited visibility

5. Aesthetic Qualities (1-5)
Visual appeal and beauty of the park landscape.
- Factors: Attractiveness, color harmony, naturalness, design coherence
- Scale: 5=highly attractive/harmonious, 3=moderately pleasant, 1=unattractive/poor quality

6. General Impression (1-5)
Overall evaluation and feeling about the park environment.
- Factors: Desirability, pleasantness, overall atmosphere
- Scale: 5=very positive/highly desirable, 3=neutral/acceptable, 1=very negative/undesirable

Output Format:
Return results in CSV format with double quotes around every field.
